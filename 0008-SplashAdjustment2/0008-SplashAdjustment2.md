# 0008-SplashAdjustment2

- Status: Proposed
- Authors: Optim Labs

## Context

After reviewing the (partial) source code of Splash we no longer believe that there has been a sufficient approval for pro rata protection in order to acquire 1% of Splash in the public launch. 

We also approve here the VE lockup of the 80/20 ODAO holdings to proceed via a yet unannounced smart contract system, and grant management over it fully to the ODAO Council.

## Proposal

### Increase Splast Pro-Rata Authorized Size

We approve an additional 1M ADA purely for pro-rata protection such that we may acquire our desired 1% SPLASH. 

The ADA returns to the general ODAO Treasury afterwards. 

### VE Lockup Method

As part of the terms of the VE Bootstrap deal, the ODAO is required to lockup the 2.5% for the maximum duration. It is at ODAO Council's discretion to manage the rest of the SPLASH ownership, with a present intent to fully max-lock it. 

Instead of going with the direct lockup method, we authorize the use of derivative contracts to achieve the desired result.
