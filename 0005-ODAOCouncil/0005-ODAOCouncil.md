# 0005 - ODAO_Council

- Status: Proposed
- Authors: Marco_112358

## Context

Optim DAO (ODAO) plans on using a 3-Branch (Tricameral) system for DAO governance. The 3 branches can be explored in more detail here (https://github.com/OptimFinance/constitutions).
The 3 branches each serve their own purpose, and balance and monitor each other while having their own consititution and self-governance. 

The Council (delta) Branch is responsible for managing the treasury. The main function of the Council is to manage the treasury, grow the treasury and finance the maintenance and growth of Optim and the ecosystem bound to develop around Optim. The constitution of the Council can be found here (https://github.com/OptimFinance/constitutions/blob/master/odao-delta.md).

DAOs in general are notoriously fickle and prone to governance attacks. In the early stages of a protocol, the core team should be managing not only the product offering, development, delivery, maintenence, etc., but also the treasury on behalf of the future DAO. Progressive decentralization is the key to not only a successful protocol but also as the future of the DAO as a whole. 

## Proposal

As the next step in progressive decentralization, I propose the creation of the first version of the Council. The Council will control a 4 signers out of 8 multisig address. Initially, the Council will have control of the 100,000 OPTIM designated for the Original proto-DAO/ODAO contributors. There were 5 main contributors since mid-2022 and more have been added over the past couple months. The original ODAO contributors will decide among themselves how to distribute the 100,000 OPTIM (2% [100,000M OPTIM] of the 5% [5M OPTIM] dedicated in proposal 0001 here https://github.com/OptimFinance/odao-proposals/blob/master/0001-LongLiveTheODAO/0001-LongLiveTheODAO.md). The distribution will likely be based heavily on tenure as a member, but also based on contribution quality and effort.

The goal will be continued trust of this Council for additional ODAO treasury assets, but in the spirit of progressive decentralization, we should start with the initial 100,000 already set in proposal 0001. The multisig will a be Roundtable multisig. The Council will create their own protocols around signing and communication of transactions to the Optim Community. Please refer to the constitution as general guidelines.

This is the first steps in progressively decentralizing governance of Optim through the ODAO. We will continue decentralization in a thoughtful manner, understanding to risks that decentralization imposes.
