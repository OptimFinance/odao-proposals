# 0003-IdleProtocolOwnedLiquidity

- Status: Proposed
- Authors: Optim Labs

## Context

The Optim Initial Liquidity Event (ILE) took in 4,000,000 in protocol owned liquidity for the OADA

As outlined in approved the ILE proposal, the allocation of the ADA POL is as follows:
1,500,000 ADA for OPTIM <> ADA liquidity pool 
2,5000,000 ADA for OADA <> ADA liquidity pool 

While the 1,500,000 ADA for the Optim <> ADA liquidity pool has been deployed to Spectrum, 2,500,000 ADA sits idle, earning approximately 3% staked, while OADA is being built. 

Liquidity Bond yield is conservatively double that of staking yield. The 3% difference between staking yield and common liquidity bond yields would earn an additional 18,750 ADA over the next 3 months assuming all 2,500,000 ADA could be deployed. 

The current timeline for OADA launch is mid to late Q1 2024, giving the idle POL approximately 3-4 months to earn above the staking rate. 

## Proposal

Deploy the 2,500,000 ADA into 1 month duration Liquidity Bonds purchased directly on the Optim dApp from original issuers. 

Deploy the 2,500,00 ADA into Liquidity Bonds listed on Danogo with a maturity no later than February 29th 2024 / Epoch 469. 

All bond purchases must yield at least 5.5% APY for the ODAO. 


1 month Liquidity Bond purchases made directly from original borrowers on Optim will cease 6 weeks prior to expected OADA deployment. Optim Labs will update the ODAO on this timeline in order to adjust Liquidity Bond purchases accordingly.
