# 0010 - VC Vesting Adjustment

- Status: Judged
- Authors: @OptimGMI

## Context

The ODAO previously proposed and passed a vote for accelerated VC vesting.

This was based on mutual trust after conversations made clear that VCs would be aligned with the best interests of the protocol and support long term growth. 

While responsible and reasonable behavior has been demonstrated, on 5/6/2024 the entire to-date distribution of an investor wallet was sold in a single transaction. This sale of over 156K OPTIM had an outsize price impact and was conducted in a reckless and irresponsible manner.

## Proposal

The investor wallet listed above is to be put on a 120 month linear vesting schedule for receipt of its remaining OPTIM tokens. 

The remaining 295,787 tokens will be distributed at a rate of 2,464 OPTIM per month.
