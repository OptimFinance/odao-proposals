Proposals to the ODAO

# Procedure

To explain in brief, the procedure begins with a proposal submitted via a Pull Request to this repository. We begin with only a simple Yes/No proposal, to expand as the governance requires it to.
- It must follow the [Proposal Template](0000-ProposalTemplate/0000-ProposalTemplate.md). 
- Every proposal begins as **Proposed**, and everyone may express their opinions on it during the *Discussion Phase*, for no less than 3 days unless in case of emergency.
- During this phase edits can be made, and it is at the Author's discression to make a final one. Proposals that go against the ODAO's constitution will not be allowed to proceed to the next phase and will be rejected immediately.
- Once a Proposal moves to an On-Chain vote, it changes status to **Judged**, and is otherwise in a frozen state. 
- After a vote finishes, it is either **Accepted** or **Rejected**. If Rejected, the proposal may be submitted again as a new pull request, with whatever adjustments are deemed necessary.
