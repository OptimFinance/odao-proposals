# 0004-POLManagement2

- Status: Accepted
- Authors: Optim Labs

## Context

Optim POL allocations are monitored and adjusted on a continuous basis as new data, market conditions, and opportunities are evaluated by the ODAO. Small, incremental adjustments are made over time, with the original allocations and directives outlined in proposals 0001-LongLiveTheODAO and 0003-POLMANAGEMENT. A conservative approach to POL deployment is favored, as the ODAO carefully considers and votes on any and all adjustments to assets.

With respect to OPTIM<>ADA POL fees thus far, the initial goals of market stabilization and fairness at launch have been achieved. The swap fee structure was originally designed to have a gradual step down in accordance with specific indicators. It is time to consider an adjustment.

With respect to the ADA from Spectrum’s LBSP SPF reward sales, the initial strategy of using half the ADA to buyback OPTIM should be reconsidered in the face of increased volumes. The buyback has a negligible impact and greater POL would be accumulated by pairing all ADA proceeds with OPTIM from the remaining 8% (8,000,000) OPTIM reserved for POL.

Regarding the timeframe for Optim Liquidity Bond purchases, the increased scope of Optim-Account and its impact on the OADA release timeframe must be considered. With a mid-April release date for OADA the cutoff for 3 month bond purchases should be extended.

## Proposal

- Adjust OPTIM <> ADA POL fees to 3%

  The POL would remain on Spectrum and be redeployed to a new 3% pool

- Pair all ADA from SPF sales with OPTIM from the remaining POL allocation

  The OPTIM <> ADA POL created is immediately added to the Spectrum pool

- Purchase 3 month Liquidity Bonds with a least 5.5% APY up until Epoch 462 / January 20th, 2024 cutoff date
