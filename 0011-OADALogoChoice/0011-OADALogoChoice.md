# 0010 - VC Vesting Adjustment

- Status: Proposed
- Authors: @zygomeb

## Context

There is an internal split on which logo to choose for OADA token, and the sOADA token.

Normally, this wouldn't even be proposed to a vote, but we weren't able to come to a consensus internally to the usual sentiment checks. 

While it may seem petty, it is not, and in fact a matter of utmost importance. 

## Proposal

Choose the Right option, or the Left option for the token image and logo for OADA.

The logos are attached in [this file](logos.webp).
