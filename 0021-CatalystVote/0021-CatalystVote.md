# 0021-CatalystVote

- Status: Proposed
- Authors: Optim Labs

## Context

Within the power given to the ODAO by 0016, the execution of the proposal was successful, and the results thereof have yielded fruits plenty, including a 20.9M ADA vote capture for the ODAO.
The results of the Catalyst Partner Program are respected and not subject to this proposal, as they have been pre-approved to be *not questioned* but simply voted on as the winners chose. 

Such a direct and meritocratic split of power has proven desirable, and in our small pilot program proven successful. 
While this proposal does not *outline* the next Catalyst Partner Program explicitly, for the next one we want to open it up for more votes, and allow more participation by projects looking to contribute.
This proposal aims to explain the thought process as well as transparently outline the plan for our stewardship of such vote power and set a clear and strong precedent for how the ODAO will vote with the captured ADA.

For any votes not subject to a transparent and freely joinable program that allows projects to earn votes, we set a commit to utilize any free votes to only vote for proposals that directly benefit the Optim project.
